# Animal Facts Carousel [view website](https://vc-fact-carousel.netlify.app)  
I created a carousel of animal facts to practice objects - storing facts as objects.

A 'random' button was also implemented that generates a random fact.

Key concepts covered:

- objects
- DOMContentLoaded
- addEventListener()
- array.length
- textContent
