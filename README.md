# Animal Facts Carousel
I created a carousel of animal facts

I also impleted an extra button that generates a random fact.
This was because I wanted to practice previous learning.

This is a good feature to have on an many sites to make webpages more interactive

Key concepts covered:

- objects
- DOMContentLoaded
- addEventListener()
- array.length
- textContent
